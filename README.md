## Experience (JUL – DEC 2023)

*   **Advisors:** [Han-Li Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m69-xGcAAAAJ&hl=en) (NCAR), [Wen Yi](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57162229500), & [Xianghui Xue](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=16023556800) (USTC)
*   Demonstrated distinct patterns of global propagation of Lamb waves in the high-resolution WACCM-X simulations with two modes at speeds of ~320 m/s and ~250 m/s, Lamb waves in certain meteor radar stations, and visualized Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) of horizontal wind in both simulation and observation.
*   First-authored presentation at the *NASA DRIVE Science Center for Geospace Storms Workshop* and *AGU 2023*.
*   Was awarded the USTC Outstanding Undergraduate Research Project (<Top 15%).

- KW (Koutian Wu) funded by: USTC Fellowship & X-Institute Senior Undergrad Res Fellow (under review); Budget: ~ 10k USD
- Orchestrated the conceptualization and methodology of the study on volcanic impacts on horizontal winds at 80–100 km altitude in the MLT (Mesosphere-Lower Thermosphere) region, using MATLAB and Python.
